# Youtube-Studio
Youtube studio is a webapp displaying a collection of youtube videos under one single roof where people can collaborate and watch videos together. Imagine you are in a virtual room along with your friends and thereâ€™s a storyboard area (aka happening area) where anybody in the room is allowed to click on the empty storyboard area and enter a youtube video URL and play them on that space.
